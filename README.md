jToxKit
=======

A kit of front-ends for accessing toxicological web services, based on [AMBIT](http://ambit.sourceforge.net). It is designed to provide easy-to-integrate
approach for using any or all of available front ends in third-party web pages.
Each different front-end is referred as _kit_. Currently available are:

- `compound` - viewer for compound datasets and query results... [more](#jtoxcompound)
- `dataset` - viewer and selector of list of datasets... [more](#jtoxdataset)
- `model` - view and selector of list of available models/algorithms... [more](#jtoxmodel)
- `substance` - browser for substances... [more](#jtoxsubstance)
- `study` - [IUCLID5](http://iuclid.eu/) substance studies visualizer... [more](#jtoxstudy)
- `query` - a wrapper around other kits and widgets, making them work together... [more](#jtoxquery).
- `search` - the search banner, integrating with jToxQuery, providing different search methods... [more](#jtoxsearch).
- `log` - a logger for all network requests, self-installing to all declared kits on the page... [more](#jtoxlog)


The toolkit is intended to be used by semi-programmers, and thus it's integration process is rather simple - referring two files and marking a placeholder in HTML of where all the structure to be inserted. However, it relies on the fact that certain external libraries like [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) and some of [jQueryUI](http://www.jqueryui.com) widgets are already included in the page.


Integration manual
------------------
In order to use **jToxKit** in your page, you need to implement these steps:

- In the header of the page add one script reference: `<script src="jtoxkit.js"></script>`. A minified version is available too: `<script src="jtoxkit.min.js"></script>`.
- In the header of the page add one stylesheet file reference: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="jtoxkit.css"/>`.
- At the place in HTML body, where you want to have some of _jToxKit_ widgets, add one _div_ element (example:`<div class="jtox-toolkit" data-kit="study"></div>`). More explanation of `data-XXX` parameters is given below. The class `jtox-toolkit` marks the insertion point for any _jToxKit_ kit.
- Make sure third-party libs that we depend on, are included too - they can vary for different (of our) _kits_, but these are common for entire **jToxKit**:

```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery-ui.css"/>
  <script src="jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="jquery.ui.core.js"></script>
```
-  The above steps are enough to have all structures inserted and _jToxKit_ initialized. If you need to make additional query calls, or similar, you can do so at any time **after** DOM is ready. For example querying _jToxStydy_ for studies for a substance from a given URL can go like this:

```
$(document).ready(function() { 
  jToxStudy.kits[0].querySubstance("http://apps.ideaconsult.net:8080/biodeg/substance/IUC4-efdb21bb-e79f-3286-a988-b6f6944d3734");
});
```

**jToxKit** itself provides certain _global_ routines, which can be invoked like `jToxKit.call()`, however for ease of use, there is an alias `jT` for `jToxKit`, so `jT.call()` is also a valid reference.

### <a href="#jtox-configuration"></a>Configuration parameters

Beside specifying the exact place of code insertion the `<div>` tag, referred above, is also used to setup the type and configuration of the front-end. There are three ways to pass configuration parameters to _jToxKit_:

- As **query parameters** on the page request itself. For example jToxTree query might look like: `toxtree.html?server=http://apps.ideaconsult.net:8080/ambit2&search=caffeine`, providing `server` parameter to _jToxKit_. These become the general, jToxKit's configuration parameters.
- As **data-XXX** attributes of the inserting _div_. They follow the common *data-XXX* naming convention, i.e. `pollDelay` is referred with `data-poll-delay`. When (each) kit it automatically inserted (the default behaviour), these settings are merged with jToxKit's and are passed on kit's initialization. They take precedence over jToxKit's.
- As **JS object** when calling `j<kit name>.init(root, settings)` manually. By default on page loading, *jToxKit* scans and initialized itself, also traversing each jToxKit's `<div>`s. The later can be suppressed by adding `data-manual-init` attribute, set to *true* to the `<div>`. In this case *j<tox-kit>* should be manually initialized, passing any desired parameters, which (again) will be merged, taking precedence over jToxKit's.

For example, the following three have the same effect:

1. Querying like this:

```
http://apps.ideaconsult.net:8080/toxbank/substance/IUC4-d982cd73-9ee1-32af-8604-962ae6875cc7/study?tab=P-CHEN&crossDomain=true
```

2. Or, embedding a jToxKit placeholder like this:

```
	<div class="jtox-toolkit" data-kit="study" data-tab="P-CHEN" data-cross-domain="true" data-substance-uri="http://apps.ideaconsult.net:8080/biodeg/substance/IUC4-d982cd73-9ee1-32af-8604-962ae6875cc7"></div>
```

3. Or, making a manual initialization like this:

```
$(document).ready(function(){
  var st = new jToxStudy($(".jtox-toolkit")[0], { crossDomain: true, tab: 'P-CHEM' });
  st.querySubstance("http://apps.ideaconsult.net:8080/toxbank/substance/IUC4-d982cd73-9ee1-32af-8604-962ae6875cc7");
``` 

Although different kits can have different configuration parameters, these are common, and can be separates in few groups:

##### Connection related

- **`kit`**  (attr. `data-kit`), _required_: specifies the exact type of front-end to be inserted. Only one type is allowed (of course!) - currently available kits are explained in the beginning.
- **`baseUrl`** (attr. `data-base-url`): the default server to be used on AJAX requests, if the server is not specified on the call itself.
- **`crossDomain`** (attr. `data-cross-domain`): informs jToxKit to send requests with cross-domain headers. It is fine to be _true_ even for same-server requests, except when Internet Explorer is used. That's why it defaults to *false*.
- **`jsonp`** (attr. `data-jsonp`): whether to use _JSONP_ style queries to the server, instead of asynchronous ones. Mind that _JSONP_ setting does not influence _POST_ requests. If this one is specified `crossDomain=true` is implied. Default is *false*.
- **`plainText`** (attr. `data-plain-text`): if you want AJAX to expect plain text, instead of JSON - set this to true. You rarely need to do so as a setting, it is more likely to need to for specific call, which can be dome via `params` parameters of `jToxKit.call()` method, which is explained later. Default is *false*.
- **`timeout`** (attr. `data-timeout`): the timeout for AJAX requests, in milliseconds. Default is 5000.
- **`pollDelay`** (attr. `data-poll-delay`): certain services involve creating a task on the server and waiting for it to finish - this is the time between poll request, while waiting it to finish. In milliseconds. Default is 200.
-##### Browsing hints 

##### Kit events handlers 

- **`onConnect`** (attr. `data-on-connect`): a function name, or function to be called just before any AJAX call.
- **`onSuccess`** (attr. `data-on-success`): a function name, or function to be called upon successful complete of a AJAX call.
- **`onError`** (attr. `data-on-error`): a function name, or function to be called when there's an error on AJAX call. The passed _callback_ to `jT.call()` is still called, but with _null_ result.
- **`onLoaded`** (attr. `data-on-loaded`): another kit-specific callback, which is called from the kit itself, when it's main querying result has arrived, be it _dataset_, _model_ or whatever. The callback is called within kit's context (i.e. the kit instance is `this`) and the returned set is passed as first agrument, which is _null_ upon erroneous result from the server. Default _null_.
- **`onDetails`** (attr. `data-on-details`): If this is not-null, it instructs the kit (_jToxCompound_, _jToxSubstance_, _jToxModel_ or _jToxDataset_) to add expand/collapse icon in the first cell of each row and include the mechanism for handling it. The handler provided here (either as _string_ or _function_) is of formt: `function (root, data, element)`, with _root_ being the details-row, cell, spawning on all but first column, _data_ is the data for the whole row and _element_ is the one that launched the openning. Default: _null_.

##### Miscellaneous

- **`noInterface`** (attr. `data-no-interface`): Whether to run in interface-less mode, so that the querying mechanism can be used from some other tool(s). Default: _false_.
- **`sDom`** (attr. `data-s-dom`): a redefinition of sDom setting for dataTables instance. It does not apply for [jToxCompound](#jtoxcompound), because it uses two, synchronized tables and custom filter and pagination controls. Default depends on the actual kit.
- **`oLanguage`** (attr. `data-o-language`): just like the above - a language definition parameter which is passed upon dataTable's initialization routine. Default is _null_.
- **`configuration`** (attr. `data-configuration`): a way to provide kit-specific configuration, like columns visibility and/or ordering for _study_ kit. If it is recognized as string value - a global variable with this name is used, otherwise - the passed object itself. No default value.
- **`configFile`** (attr. `data-config-file`) _optional_: Another way to provide configuration for a kit, but this time - providing the name/path of external JSON file, which is downloaded and used as configuration parameter. No default value.
- **`selectionHandler`** (attr. `data-selection-handler`): If present (i.e. not null) it makes the kit (all except _jToxCompound_) show a checkbox in the first column for each entry. The value provided here is used as `data-handler`, i.e. - it gives the name of the handler invoked by encapsulating _jToxQuery_, when the selection changes it's value. Default: _null_.


As, can be seen, the three connection callbacks can be local for each kit, so it is possible to report connection statuses in the most appropriate for the kit's way. This is also true for Url's, which means that not all kits, needs to communicate with one and the same server.

### jToxKit methods

There are certain methods that are common for all kits and some kit wrappers - like [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery) - rely on having them:

```
jToxKit.initKit(element)
```
The actual kit initialization procedure - it determines the kit that need to be used relying on `data-kit` option and creates a new instance, passing the `element` as kit's root. It is automatically invoked for kits, not marked as `manualInit`, however it can be called from the JS code for such kits and all initialization and configuration procedure goes as needed.


```
jToxKit.kit(element)
```
Returns the instance of the kit that has the passed `element` as its root. When passed a `<div>` element, marked with `jtox-toolkit` class - this method will return the instance that was created during kit's initialization, i.e. - during `initKit()` call.


```
jToxKit.parentKit(prototype, element)
```
Returns the instance of `prototype` which has its root as the closest parent of `element`. In other words - traverses up all the parents of `element` until it reaches a jToxKit's kit, which is of given `prototype`.


```
jToxKit.insertTool(name, root)
```
Inserts a third-party tool, which was added to jToxKit's production files, like _ketcher_, for example. It inserts that HTML code for the `name` tool under the passed `root`. If this tool has separate script files (and it probably does), it needs to be included separately on the page.

```
jToxKit.call(kit, service, params, callback)
```
The general function for making server calls - all other kits should use _this_ method. The passed `kit` instance's settings are used for _baseUrl_, _crossDomain_, _jsonp_ other that may be relevant. If null is passed - the default settings from _jToxKit_ itself are used. The most important parameter is `service` which determines the actual call to be made. The next parameter `params` is explained later - it can be omitted. Finally there is `callback`, which is called in both success and error. It's format is `function callback(result, jhr)`, where `result` is what came from server, or _null_ on error, and `jhr` is the actual jQuery AJAX object.
The `params` parameter (if present) can have the following properties:
- `data` - additional that need to be passed, this usually means also the method is _POST_ and it is set so, if not specified explicitly;
- `method` - the HTTP method to be used. The default is _GET_, but if some `data` is passed - it defaults to _POST_.
- `dataType` - if you want to change the expected server response to something different from JSON - use this one.

### UI methods

There is a bunch of methods, which are responsible for some pure UI-related stuff within jToxKit. They can be found in `jToxKit.ui` or `jT.ui`, and although most of them are internally used by the kits, here is a short explanation of most important ones:

```
jToxKit.ui.shortenedData(content, message, data)
```
A method for shortening passed `content`, wrap it into a separate `div` block and make it clipboard insertable if `message` is supplied. The clipboard copied data is `data` or `content` if the first one is null.

```
jToxKit.ui.changeTabsIds(root, suffix)
```
When you have jQueryUI tabs' plugin used, it relies on `id`s of elements, and when you use same kit more than once you'll end up having id duplication. This function takes care of that - it adds gives `suffix` to ids of all `a` and corresponding `div` elements which are part of tabs' structure.

```
jToxKit.ui.processColumns(kit, category)
```
Most of kits have a mechanism for providing column configuration and this function takes provided `kit`'s default columns _and_ provided ones (remember - they live in `<kit>.settings.configuration.columns`) and build up the final column listing the way it can be provided to [dataTables](http://datatables.net) plugin which is used all around.

```
jToxKit.ui.putStars(kit, stars, title)
```
Put a `stars` number of stars, using provided `kit`'s stars format setting and putting given `title` as hover tooltip.

```
jToxKit.ui.bindControls(kit, handlers)
```
The two most important kits - [jToxCompound](#jtoxcompound) and [jToxSubstance](#jtoxsubstance) have their own paging and filtering mechanism. This function puts the necessary controls _and_ handling so that they start to work. Look at the code for more details.

```
jToxKit.putActions(kit, col, defs)
```
Alters the given `col`umn's _mRender_ function so that it includes also _selection_ and/or _details_ icons - depending on provided `defs`. Check the code of [jToxSubstance](#jtoxsubstance), [jToxModel](#jtoxmodel) and [jToxDataset](#jtoxdataset) for more details.

```
jToxKit.updateCounter(str, count, total)
```
Update a counter within a given `str`. The counter can be either of this form: `(1/14)`, or just a simple number: `(14)` - which is the case when `total` is not passed. This method find old such form, if exists, and updates it.


### Kit instance common methods
```
<kit class>.kits
```
An array with all kit instances from this _kit class_. For example:
`jToxQuery.kits[0]` is the first instance of jToxQuery found on the page.

```
<kit instance>.modifyUri(uri)
```
When a certain kit is wrapped with another one, like the way `jToxQuery` wraps `jToxSearch` - this is the mechanism which allows `jToxQuery` to collect "preferences" of all sub-widgets, before passing the so-constructed `uri` to the main kit. Refer [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery)'s documentation for more information.

```
<kit instance>.query(uri)
```
A shorthand, general method, that _jToxQuery_ can call on any (main) kit, to perform it's preferred query method. For example for [jToxCompound](#jtoxcompound) this method is another way to call `<jToxCompound>.queryDataset(datasetUri)`.


<a name="jtoxcompound"></a> jToxCompound kit
--------------------------------------------

An OpenTox compound dataset management and visualization tool. Since _compound_ is very basic term in OpenTox hierarchy it is used in other places like [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery) and [jToxTree kit](#jtoxtree). It is vital to understand that the scope of this kit it _not_ to provide complete, versatile interface for making queries, linking between them, etc. - it aims at visualizing and providing basic navigation within _one_ particular query. It is designed to be easily configurable - up to the point of being only one table, and easily driven with API calls, which are explained below.

As a consequence of this perspective, all functionality as filtering and ordering, is applied to the currently downloaded dataset entries, i.e. - one "page" of the dataset. This is due to the fact that for many datasets it is impossible to have general procedures applied to them, thus the scope of this kit is limited to local visualization functions only.

##### Dependencies

It has less dependencies, compare to jToxStudy, namely they are:

```
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.ui.tabs.css"/>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.dataTables.css"/>
	<script src="jquery.ui.widget.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.ui.tabs.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.dataTables.js"></script>
```

##### Parameters

Parameters that can be passed either with data-XXX attributes or when initialized manually with JavaScript are:

- **`datasetUri`** (attr. `data-dataset-uri`): This is the main URL of the dataset, that later is used for features query, pagination, etc. If not passed initially, a later call to `queryDataset(datasetUri)` has the same effect. 
- **`showTabs`** (attr. `data-show-tabs`): Determines if the feature enabling / disabling tabs should be visible, or not. Default: *true*.
- **`tabsFolded`** (attr. `data-tabe-folded`): If set to _true_ initializes the feature-selection tabs to be initially all closed. Has no meaning when `showTabs` is _false_. Default is _false_.
- **`showExport`** (attr. `data-show-export`): Determines if the **Export** tab should be added to the right of feature-tabs, filled with possible export parameters. If `showTabs` is false, this has not effect, of course. Default: *true*.
- **`showControls`** (attr. `data-show-controls`): Determines whether to show the block with filter and pagination controls, which include: information for current view items, dropdown menu for choosing the page size, next and previous page and filtering box. Default: *true*.
- **`pageStart`** (attr. `data-page-start`):From which item the referenced dataset should be visualized. Counted from 0. Default: *0*.
- **`pageSize`** (attr. `data-page-size`): Initial page size for queries - can later be changed either with `queryEntries()` call, or with dropdown menu, if visible. Default: *20*. 
- **`hideEmpty`** (attr. `data-hide-empty`): Determines whether to hide empty group tabs instead of make them inactive. Default: _false_.
- **`showUnits`** (attr. `data-show-units`): Whether to show the units of each feature in the column title. Default: _true_.
- **`groupSelection`** (attr. `data-group-selection`): Whether to show (un)select all links in each tab. Default: _true_.
- **`hasDetails`** (attr. `data-has-details`): Determines whether a details opening icon and all corresponding functionality, should be shown on each row. Default: _true_.
- **`detailsHeight`** (attr. `data-details-height`): Determines the height of details pane, when opened, in pixels (e.g. `"250px"`). When not specified the default height is double the row height upon opening the details.
- **`rememberChecks`** (attr. `data-remember-checks`): Whether to remember feature check states, between different _queryDataset()_ calls. Default: _false_.
- **`metricFeature`** (attr. `data-metric-feature`): The ID of the feature that should be used, when 'metric' field is present in the dataset. Default: *http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#Similarity*.
- **`fnAccumulate`** (attr. `data-fn-accumulate`): The function that should be called during dataset entries' processing, when several values need to be accumulated in the same place. The format of the function is `function fnlocation(featureId, oldValue, newValue, features)`. The default one is concatenating the passed values as comma-separated string.
- **`onTab`** (attr. `data-on-tab`): A callback which is called after each group tab is created - be it form the main ones, or per compound (in detailed view). The format of the function is `function (element, tab, name, isMain)`: `element` being the content _div_ HTML element, `tab`, being the link (_li_) HTML element, for opening the tab. Other's are pretty clear. Default is _null_.
- **`onPrepared`** (attr. `data-on-prepared`): A callback which is called when the initial call for determining the columns, tabs etc. has completed. The one-entry dataset is passed as a parameter, the context (i.e. _this_) is the kit itself. Default: _null_.
- **`preDetails`** (attr. `data-pred-details`): A callback which is called just before opening a details pane - if it returns _false_, details is not opened at all. The format is `function preDetails(index, cell)`, where index is data index and cell is the details cell on the row. Default is _null_.


##### Configuration

Feature enabling-disabling functions and dataset entry detailed visualization rely pretty much on proper grouping of the features. There is a predefined default grouping, but it can be changed via `configuration` parameter. It is find in `group` member of it, which has the following syntax:

```
"groups" : {
	"<group name>": <array> | <function>,
	...
}
```
The `<array>` option, means an array of feature IDs, the `<function>` option is a function with following syntax: `function (groupName, miniDataset)` which should return (again) an array of feature IDs that are part of that group. It can either be function object itself, or function-name, if configuration is passed via external _json_.
The first parameter (`groupName`) is the name of the group being filled, and the second parameter - `miniDataset` is the 1-sized dataset that _jToxStudy_ queried to obtain the available features, with `features` property pre-processed. The context in which the function is called is the _jToxKit_ instance (i.e. `this` parameter).
A special case is when one (or more) of the member of the array is (are) objects and not string. This is used when certain bunch of features need to be grouped in one checkbox. The format of the object should be:

```
{ "name": "Group name", "features": [ ... <array of features> ] };
```
This can be part of the array. For example the default _Names_ group can look like this:

```
    "Names": [
      "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#ChemicalName",
      "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#TradeName",
      "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#IUPACName",
      { "name": "Formulas",
        "features": [
          "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#SMILES",
          "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#InChIKey",
          "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#InChI",
        ]
      },
      "http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#REACHRegistrationDate"
    ],
```
Which will result in all formula-related features to be grouped in one, named _Formulas_ and thus, turning on and off can be done from single checkbox.

Another aspect that can be configured from there is the list of possible exports, it has the following format:

```
"exports": [
	{type: "<MIME type for export>", icon: "<icon location, relative to current page>"},
	...
]
```

And now, we've finally got to explaining each feature's configuration options:

```
"baseFeatures": {
	"<featureId": {
		title: "<readable title>",
		data: "<location in data entry of the value of that feature>",
		accumulate: true | false, // whether value of this feature need to be accumulated
		search: true | false, // is this feature searchable
		basic: true | false, // is it a basic, feature with custom behaviour?
		used: true | false, // put true if you want to make sure it won't show up on Other tab
		visibility: none | all | main | details,
		column: <object to be merged with dataTable column definition | function definition>
		process: <function name | definition to be called during feature preparation>,
		render: <function definition - used for rendering feature values (also - as mRender)>,
	},
	...
}
```

All of them are optional, and it is good to remember that these are merged with feature definitions as they arrive from the server.

- **`title`**, _string_: The title of this feature as it'll appear in the column titles;
- **`data`**, _string_: A "path" within a compound entry to the value of this feature, i.e. - location within the object. For example: `"http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1#CASRN" : { title: "CAS", data: "compound.cas"}` feature's (and all that have it as `sameAs`!) value can be found in `compound.cas`. This property (_data_) can also be an array - see the description of _accumulate_ about this.
- **`accumulate`**, _boolean_: This one is used in conjunction with the previous one. During dataset pre-processing, the desired final value for a feature can be formed in arbitrary way from compound's entry. For example, we might want to have several (different) features that we know are semantically equal (like **Name**, **TradeName**) to accumulate their values in one and the same location within compound's entry. Marking _accumulate_ to `true` instructs the automatic entry processing to do so - the location is given in `data`. Thus, _data_ can be an array - if we want to accumulate to several places.
- **`search`**, _boolean_: Whether this feature is searchable during table filtering. Default is _true_.
- **`primary`**, _boolean_: If _true_ this feature will be places in the left, static table, which is not scrollable, otherwise - it is placed in the right one. Default: _false_.
- **`basic`**, _boolean_: Whether this is _basic_ feature, which has it's custom grouping and handling. For example, _Other_ group default function ignores these. Default: _false_.
- **`used`**, _boolean_: In the process of grouping features, this one is used to mark when a feature is already placed in some group. You can use it if you want to keep a feature away from going into any (default) group. Default: _false_.
- **`visibility`**, _none_ | _all_ | _main_ | _details_: Where do you want to have this feature shown - either on feature-selection tab only (_main_, example: _#Diagram_), in detailed view, tabs only (_details_) on both (_all_) or neither (_none_). Default: _all_.
- **`column`**, _object_ or _function_: This is a normal _dataTable_'s column definition that will be merged with automatically built one, if present. If function is passed - it is expected to with this definition: `function(column, featureId)` and should return the new column definition. Default: _null_.
- **`render`**, _function_: The value render function for this feature. It has the dataTable's `mRender` syntax: `function (data, type, full)` and it is, actually used for that purpose, if present (taking precedence over _mRender_ property of `column` object). There is one difference - one more _type_ of rendering is given: _details_, which gives the configurator the ability to have different rendering for that special purpose - value of feature within details pane.
- **`process`**, _function_: This one is used during dataset preprocessing and is called for each entry and feature (if given at all). It's definition should be of this form: `function process(entry, featureId, features)`. Default: _null_.

In the full configuration, shown below example of using last two can be seen for _Diagram_ property. The standard `columns` part of the configuration refers to the detailed view, feature table:

```
{
      "columns": {
        "compound": {
          "Name": { sTitle: "Name", mData: 'title', mRender: ... },
          "Value": { sTitle: "Value", mData: 'value', sDefaultContent: "-" },
          "SameAs": { sTitle: "SameAs", mData: 'sameAs', sDefaultContent: "-" },
          "Source": { sTitle: "Source", mData: 'source', sDefaultContent: "-", mRender: ... }

##### Methods

_jToxCompound_ has several methods to drive visualization, as well as several "static" ones, which makes it possible for other kits to use its functionality. Let's start with these:


```
jToxCompound.processDataset(dataset, features, fnValue, startIdx)
```
Only the first parameter `dataset` is required and it is the downloaded dataset, as is from the OpenTox server. If features are already preprocessed (see below) they can be passed here as second parameter - `features`. The third - `fnValue` is a user-provided function that takes part during each entry's preprocessing, it is explained in details in a second. The last parameter `startIdx` is the starting index within the dataset, if a call is made for some other part of the dataset. Remember - this is a static call and it does _not_ preserve context information like page size, index, etc.


```
jToxCompound.processFeatures(features)
```
Very important function in unified feature processing. It traverses all reported features, merging those that mean one and the same thing, as reported by their `sameAs` parameter, also takes care of predefined features that can instruct it to "location" certain feature value inside the dataset entry, itself. This is called internally by `processDataset()` or should be called if `features` parameter is passed to the later.


```
jToxCompound.processEntry(entry, features, fnValue)
```
Used extensively during dataset preprocessing. When traversing the dataset, each `entry` is passed with already preprocessed `features` so that features that need to have their values extracted and set separately _are_ processed here. Also, if several features are setup to location their values in same entry's property - it is also done here. `fnValue` function (the same passed to `processDataset()`) can participate in the process, it has the following definition: `fnValue(oldValue, newValue)`.


```
jToxCompound.extractFeatures(entry, features, callback)
```
A shorthand function which extracts all feature values from the given `entry`, processing them according to `features` definitions passed, filters out those with empty titles, and returns an array of features, with one field added - `value`. On each added entry `callback` is called in this manner `function (feature, featureId)` (after `value` property is set) and if the returned value is _false_ the feature entry is not added at all.


```
<jToxCompound>.queryDataset(datasetUri)
```
The starting point of dataset visualization. This function makes a separate call for feature-retrieving, preprocesses them (as described above), prepares the visualization table, showing or hiding, whatever is needed and calls `processEntries` for actual dataset entries' retrieval. Cannot be called several times within same instance.

```
<jToxCompound>.queryEntries(start, size)
```
The actual dataset entries retrieving function. It makes call to get entries from the already set up dataset, starting from `start`-th one and asking for `size` of them. All pagination UI elements are updated, if not hidden.


```
<jToxCompound>.equalizeTables()
```
A UI-related, function which takes care the two tables - fixed and variable parts, to be with equally sized rows - it is handy when some manual changing of values within the table cells is performed from outside. Normally it is not necessary to call it, because all details opening, filtering, etc. takes care to call it internally.


```
<jToxCompound>.nextPage()
<jToxCompound>.prevPage()
```
These two are shortcuts for the previous function, taking into account the current page size and also taking care not to query for something outside of the known limits of the dataset.

```
<jToxCompound>.filterEntries(needle)
```
Filter the presented entries with the given needle, finding substring match on each features, not marked with `search: false` in their definition.


<a name="jtoxsubstance"></a> jToxSubstance kit
----------------------------------------------

This kit is responsible for substance browsing, pretty much the same way _jToxCompound_ is responsible for compound browsing. However, for this one it is more simplistic, because it happens on single table and with less controls.

##### Parameters

The kit has the following parameters:

- **`showControls`** (attr. `data-show-controls`): Determines whether to show the block with filter and pagination controls, which include: information for current view items, dropdown menu for choosing the page size, next and previous page and filtering box. Default: *true*.
- **`embedComposition`** (attr. `data-embed-composition`): Instructs the kit to embed a _jToxComposition_ instance as the substance detailed view. If an _object_ is passed - it is merged with _jToxSubstance_'s options and used during _jToxComposition_'s instance initialization. The _embedComposition_ option has no meaning if `onDetails` is passed. Default is _null_.
- **`pageStart`** (attr. `data-page-start`): From which item the referenced substance set should be visualized. Counted from 0. Default: *0*.
- **`pageSize`** (attr. `data-page-size`): Initial page size for queries - can later be changed either with `queryEntries()` call, or with dropdown menu, if visible. Default: *10*. 
- **`substanceUri`** (attr. `data-substance-uri`): The uri that should be queried for retrieving the list of substances. If present the query is made upon initialization, if not - `querySubstance()` can be used for later call.

##### Methods

Methods of this kit that can be used are:

```
<jToxSubstance>.querySubstance(uri)
```
As expected - it initiates a query for list of substances. Some paging information can be present in the URI - it is stripped, remembered and used. Also it overides the ones, provided with settings, if any.

```
<jToxSubstance>.query(uri)
```
A shorthand for the previous method.

```
<jToxSubstance>.nextPage()
<jToxSubstance>.prevPage()
```
Pagination control - works as expected, taking care not to go after the end, or before the beginning.


##### Configuration

As usually, columns can be configured. They are wrapped in the `substance` category. Here is how the default one looks like:

```
    configuration: { 
      columns : {
        substance: {
          'Id': { sTitle: 'Id', mData: 'URI', sDefaultContent: "-", sWidth: "60px", mRender: ...},
          'Substance Name': { sTitle: "Substance Name", mData: "name", sDefaultContent: "-" },
          'Substance UUID': { sTitle: "Substance UUID", mData: "i5uuid", mRender: ...},
          'Composition Type': { sTitle: "Composition Type", mData: "substanceType", sWidth: "15%", sDefaultContent: '-' },
          'Public name': { sTitle: "Public name", mData: "publicname", sDefaultContent: '-'},
          'Reference substance UUID': { sTitle: "Reference substance UUID", mData: "referenceSubstance", mRender: ...},
          'Owner': { sTitle: "Owner", mData: "ownerName", sDefaultContent: '-'},
          'Info': { sTitle: "Info", mData: "externalIdentifiers", mRender: ...}
        }
      }
    }

```


<a name="jtoxstudy"></a> jToxStudy kit
--------------------------------------

This kit gives front-end to AMBIT services, which provide import of IUCLID5 generated and maintained data for toxicological studies (experiments). The kit name is `study` (for use in `data-kit` initialization attribute). First, there are several additional

##### Dependencies

From [jQueryUI](http://www.jqueryui.com) Version 1.8+, based library *jQueryUI tabs* and jQuery based [DataTables](http:/www.datatables.net) Version 1.9+. For column resizing we also depend on [colResizable](http://quocity.com/colresizable/), which in turn needs [jQuery migrate plugin](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-migrate-plugin) for its reference of `$.explorer` - feel free not to include the latest, if you don't have such error from _colResizable_ (they might update not to use it, some day).

```
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.ui.tabs.css"/>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.dataTables.css"/>
	<script src="jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"></script>
	<script src="colResizable-1.3.min.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.ui.widget.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.ui.tabs.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.dataTables.js"></script>
```

These are needed in the same page in order for _jToxStudy_ to work. It has some additional

##### Parameters

Not quite a lot yet, mainly event handlers:

- **`substanceUri`** (attr. `data-substance-uri`): This is the URL of the substance in question. If it is passed during _jToxStudy_ initialization a call to `jToxStudy.querySubstance(uri)` is made. In either case upon successful substance info retrieval automatic calls to `jToxStudy.querySummary(uri)` and `jToxStudy.queryComposition(uri)` are made.
- **`tab`** (attr. `data-tab`): Specifying which study top-category should be preloaded upon page loading. It can be either _encodeURIComponent()_ encoded, or spaces replaced with underscore.
- **`onLoaded`** (attr. `data-on-loaded`): This one is invoked when the general information for the substance is loaded - before all supplementary info is even queries (like composition, studies, etc.). As usual the context (i.e. _this_) is the kit itself, and the passed parameter is the substance data retrieved from the server. Default: _null_.
- **`onSummary`** (attr. `data-on-summary`): Invoked when study summary information arrives from the server. Passed as parameter, within kit's context (i.e. _this_). Default: _null_.
- **`onComposition`** (attr. `data-on-composition`): Invoked when the composition info for that substance arrives from the server. It is passed as a parameter within kit's context (i.e. _this_). Default: _null_.
- **`onStudy`** (attr. `data-on-study`): This one is invoked when a set of studies for certain category arrives from the server. The array of studies is passed as a parameter, again within kit's context (i.e. _this_). Default: _null_.

##### Configuration

The configuration structure as passed to the kit initialization or references with `data-config-file` is used to give column visibility and re-naming possibilities. An example of valid configuration object / json is this:

```
{
	"columns": {
		"_": { 
			"main": { 
				"name": { "bVisible": false } 
			},
			"effects": {
				"endpoint": { "sTitle": "Type", "iOrder": -2 },
				"result": { "sTitle": "Value", "iOrder": -1 }
			}
		},
		"PC_PARTITION_SECTION": {
			"effects": {
				"endpoint": { "iOrder": 0 },
				"result": { "iOrder": 0 }
			}
		}
	}
}
```

All column redefinitions are following _dataTables_ syntax, but only parameters that need to be changed are given. Additional `iOrder` is used to make reordering of the column in the table. The rule is:

- If `iOrder` is missing in column definition it is considered **0**.
- Columns are sorted on `iOrder` attribute before being passed to _dataTable_ initialization routine.

The standard `bVisible` parameter can be present (usually only for hiding) which makes the column absent from column definitions at all.

Each column (re)definitions are grouped on several levels:

- (_low_) The semantic meaning: `parameters`, `conditions`, `effects`, `protocol`, `interpretation` and `main`.
- (_high_) Per study category definitions are possible, so different categories can have different naming, ordering and visibility. The `_` category is the default.

So the actual column re-definition goes like this:

- First, the normal definition of column is taken, either from defaults or from study parsing;
- Second, if present, the column (re)definition from default category (`_`) for this column title is merge with it, overwriting existing attributes.
- Finally, if present, the column (re)definition for category-specific section, again identified with column title (the original one), is merged/overwritten.
- If this, final, column definition has `bVisible` to be present and false - the column is extracted from further processing and addition.

The array of so built columns is then sorted on `iOrder` and passed to _dataTables_ initialization.


##### Methods

_jToxStudy_ methods that can be invoked from outside are quite few, actually:


```
new jToxStudy(root, settings)
```
It is called either internally from _jToxKit_ upon initialization, or later from the user. The first parameter is an _HTMLElement_ which will be used for base for populating necessary DOM tree. It returns a new instance of jToxStudy, referred as `<jToxStudy>` that can later be queried with methods, described below:


```
<jToxStudy>.querySubstance(substanceUri)
```
If `substanceUri` parameter is not provided during initialization, this is the way to ask for studies for particular substance. Fill's up the fist tab and queries for _composition_ and _studies summary_.


```
<jToxStudy>.queryComposition(substanceUri)
```
The `substanceUri` is the same as in previous function, but this one takes care only for _Composition_ tab. Usually called automatically from previous function, when it successfully retrieved substance information.


```
<jToxStudy>.querySummary(substanceUri)
```
The `substanceUri` is the same as in previous function. This one queries for a summary of all studies available for the given substance. It fills up the numbers in the studies' tabs and prepares the tables for particular queries later on, which are executes upon each tab's activation.


<a name="jtoxdataset"></a> jToxDataset kit
------------------------------------------

The dataset(s) browsing kit - if [jToxCompound](#jtoxcompound) is browsing entries within a data, this kit is browsing datasets on a server. It is rather simple and is mainly used as a widget within [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery) kit.

##### Parameters

There are few things that can be setup from outside:

- **`maxStars`** (attr. `data-max-stars`): How many stars are considered maximum, when building the long version of ratings. Default: _10_.
- **`shortStars`** (attr. `data-short-stars`): Whether to show show star rating notation, i.e. - one star and the number of stars next to it, opposed to the long (default) version - always showing the maximum number of stars, with given number of them - highlighted. Default is _false_.
- **`loadOnInit`** (attr. `data-load-on-init`): Whether to make an initial query even when _datasetUri_ is not specified. Default is _false_.
- **`sDom`** (attr. `data-s-dom`): The redefinition of _sDom_ attribute for the table. Default _"\<Fif\>rt"_.
- **`datasetUri`** (attr. `data-dataset-uri`): The address to query for list of datasets. If none is passed, the standard `<baseURL>/dataset` is used.


##### Methods

They are not plenty - just a few:

```
<jToxDataset>.listDatasets(uri)
<jToxDataset>.query(uri)
```
Makes a query for retrieving the list of datasets from the server. If `uri` passed is null - the default form: `<baseURL>/dataset` is used.

```
<jToxDataset>.modifyUri(uri)
```
The required method for this kit to be part of [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery) kit. What it does is to scan all input boxes, which means `selectable` should be set to _true_, and add `dataset_uris[]=<selected uri>` parameter to the given `uri` for each of selected datasets.

There are several public static methods, that can be used from elsewhere:

```
jToxDataset.putStars(kit, stars, title)
```
Returns an _html_ text with given amount of `stars` put, taking into account the kit's settings for _maxStars_ and _shortStars_. The _title_ is the tooltip that is set for the block.

```
jToxDataset.addSelection(kit, oldFn)
```
Returns a _dataTables_ rendering function (i.e. `function (data, type, full)`), using the provided old one - `oldFn`, and adding a selection box, with proper handling before it.

##### Configuration

All the columns of the table can be configured, the same way [jToxStudy](#jtoxstudy) does. All column definitions are found under `dataset` property. The default set looks like this:

```
configuration: { 
  columns : {
    dataset: {
      'Id': { iOrder: 0, sTitle: "Id", mData: "URI", sWidth: "50px", mRender: function ... },
      'Title': { iOrder: 1, sTitle: "Title", mData: "title", sDefaultContent: "-" },
      'Stars': { iOrder: 2, sTitle: "Stars", mData: "stars", sWidth: "160px" },
      'Info': { iOrder: 3, sTitle: "Info", mData: "rights", mRender: function ... }
    }
  }
}

```

More columns can be added, or these can be turned off just by adding `bVisible: false` to the certain definition.

<a name="jtoxmodel"></a> jToxModel kit
------------------------------------------

The model(s) and algorithm(s) browsing kit - pretty similar to [jToxDataet](#jtoxdataset) as functionality and configuration. However, it has two modes of running - algorithm listing or model listing, and it is upon initialization. This kit is mainly used as a widget within [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery) kit.

##### Parameters

There are few things that can be setup from outside:

- **`algorithmLink`** (attr. `data-algorithm-link`): Determines whether to add a link for viewing models filtered on specific algorithm. It'll put a link on each row and make a new request for the whole page. Other way of filtering will be to use the _dataTable_'s filter box, which won't navigate to a different page. Default: _false_.
- **`algorithms`** (attr. `data-algorithms`): Whether to list available algorithms, rather than available models. Default: _false_.
- **`maxStars`** (attr. `data-max-stars`): How many stars are considered maximum, when building the long version of ratings. Default: _10_.
- **`shortStars`** (attr. `data-short-stars`): Whether to show show star rating notation, i.e. - one star and the number of stars next to it, opposed to the long (default) version - always showing the maximum number of stars, with given number of them - highlighted. Default is _false_.
- **`loadOnInit`** (attr. `data-load-on-init`): Whether to make an initial query even when _modelUri_ or _algorithmNeedle_ are not specified. Default is _false_.
- **`sDom`** (attr. `data-s-dom`): The redefinition of _sDom_ attribute for the table. Default _"\<Fif\>rt"_.
- **`modelUri`** (attr. `data-model-uri`): The address to query for list of models. If none is passed, the standard `<baseURL>/model` is used.
- **`algorithmNeedle`** (attr. `data-algorithms-needle`): If algorithms listing mode is selected (`algorithms` = _true_) - this is the needle to be used when listing them. Default: _null_.
- **`forceCreate`** (attr. `data-force-create`): When creating a model from an algorithm, the kit usually tries to obtain one from the server, and only if that fails it makes a _create model_ query, unless this option is specified, which instructs the kit to directly try to create a new one. Default _false_.


##### Methods

They are not plenty - just a few:

```
<jToxModel>.listModels(uri)
```
Makes a query for retrieving the list of models from the server. If `uri` passed is null - the default form: `<baseURL>/model` is used.


```
<jToxModel>.listAlgorithms(needle)
```
Makes a query for retrieving all available algorithms from the server. If `needle` is passed it is used in the search of the form: `<baseURL>/algorithms?search=<needle>`.

```
<jToxModel>.query(uri)
```
This is a shortcut to either _listModels()_ or _listAlgorithms()_ method, depending on `settings.algorithms` parameter.


```
<jToxModel>.modifyUri(uri)
```
The required method for this kit to be part of [jToxQuery](#jtoxquery) kit. What it does is to scan all input boxes, which means `selectable` should be set to _true_, and add `feature_uris[]=<selected uri>` parameter to the given `uri` for each of selected models.


```
<jToxModel>.getModel(algoUri, callback)
```
Gets or creates a model for given algorithm. If _forceCreate_ is not specified in the options it first asks the server for such model, only if that fails - it makes a _PUSH_ request to create a new one, then polls the given task. In any case - the `callback` is called after all is done - either with the _modelURI_, or with _null_ if everything fails. This is the first parameter, the second is jQuery's ajax, `jhr` parameter.


```
<jToxModel>.runPrediction(datasetUri, modelUri, callback)
```
Instructs the server to run a prediction of `modelUri` onto given `datasetUri` and calls `callback` when all is done with object in _dataset_ format as first parameter (or _null_, on fail) and jQuery's ajax `jhr` parameter as second. Again - the method first asks the server if it has predictions for this model and dataset cached, and if not - it initiates a task for prediction, polls it until is done and only then invokes the `callback`.


##### Configuration

All the columns of the table can be configured, the same way [jToxStudy](#jtoxstudy) does. All column definitions are found under `model` or `algorithm` properties, depending on the mode the kit is running. The default set looks like this:

```
configuration: { 
  columns : {
    model: {
     'Id': { iOrder: 0, sTitle: "Id", mData: "id", sWidth: "50px", mRender: function ... },
     'Title': { iOrder: 1, sTitle: "Title", mData: "title", sDefaultContent: "-" },
     'Stars': { iOrder: 2, sTitle: "Stars", mData: "stars", sWidth: "160px" },
     'Algorithm': {iOrder: 3, sTitle: "Algorithm", mData: "algorithm" },
     'Info': { iOrder: 4, sTitle: "Info", mData: "trainingDataset", mRender: function ... }
    },
    algorithm: {
     'Id': { iOrder: 0, sTitle: "Id", mData: "id", sWidth: "150px", mRender: function ... },
     'Title': { iOrder: 1, sTitle: "Title", mData: "name", sDefaultContent: "-" },
     'Description': {iOrder: 2, sTitle: "Description", sClass: "shortened", mData: "description", sDefaultContent: '-' },
     'Info': { iOrder: 3, sTitle: "Info", mData: "format", mRender: function ... }
    }
  }
}

```

More columns can be added, or these can be turned off just by adding `bVisible: false` to the certain definition.


<a name="jtoxquery"></a> jToxQuery kit
--------------------------------------

A general purpose kit, that wraps several others to make them work together. For example - in the normal query & browse user experience, when you need to define certain criteria for your search and have a browser interpret them - you actually have one _browser_ component and one or more other, that alter the actual data to be browsed, i.e. - they alter the server queries that are made to obtain the data to be browsed. The key aspect of _jToxQuery_ is that it is independent of underlying components (kits). Of course, it relying on certain structure and behaviour.

There are two type of sub-kits: _main kit_ (only one) and _widgets_ (zero or more). There is one way to determine which is which - widgets have `jtox-widget` class added to their root element. All such are enumerated and treated a bit different.

There is another important term here: _handler_, these are DOM elements that should initiate some kind of action via _jToxQuery_. These can be _input_ elements, _select_, _button_, etc. - anything that reacts on _change_ or _click_ events. They to mark an element as handler-active is to add `jtox-handler` to it's classes and then specify the name of the handler to be called, via `data-handler` attribute. Doing so, _jToxQuery_ will take care to invoke this handler, when a change/click happens on this element.

How are handlers specified? Using the standard _configuration_ mechanism - there is a `handler` object under `configuration` key, which is in _jToxQuery_'s settings. This is how the default settings for _jToxQuery_ look like:

```
{ 
  configuration: {
    // this is the main thing to be configured
    handlers: { 
      query: function (el, query) { query.query(); },
    }
  }
};
```

As can be seen, each handler function is passed two arguments: `el` - the element which provoked this handler, to be called, and `query` - the instance of jToxQuery which is mitigating the call. Having that, if you define button in your HTML:

```
<button name="searchbutton" class="jtox-handler" title="Search" data-handler="query"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-search"/></button>
```
You'll have _jToxQuery_ call the `query()` method of the _main kit_ each time the user presses this button.

There are two ways to enrich this list of handlers - pass proper _configuration_ to the _jToxQuery_ kit itself, or call `<jToxQuery>.addHandlers(handlers)` passing an object with additional handlers that you intend to use. They way to find kit's parent _jToxQuery_ instance is using `jToxKit.parentKit(jToxQuery, <kit's root element>)` method, described above.

##### Parameters

There are few things that can be setup from outside:

- **`scanDom`** (attr. `data-scan-dom`): It can be used to stop _jToxQuery_ from scanning it's sub-elements to discover and built the _widgets_ list. Default: _true_.
- **`kitSelector`** (attr. `data-kit-selector`): If you want to provide the main kit for querying yourself, this is the way to achieve it. Normally _jToxQuery_ will scan all it's children (see _scanDom_), but if the kit being targeted, it's not going to be found this way. The string provided here is passed in jQuery call and the resulting element used. Default _null_.
- **`dom`**: It can't be passed with data attribute, because it is an object with two properties: `widgets` and `kit`, which can contain the DOM elements, which are roots of _widgets_ and the _main kit_ of jToxQuery. This can be used, when you want to specify them yourself, like the case when they are not _under_ the jToxQuery's root. Default _null_.
- **`initialQuery`** (atrt. `data-initial-query`): Whether to make a initiate a query immediately after all (sub)kits are initialized. Default is _false_.
- **`service`** (attr. `data-service`): The initial service/uri string to be used, when building the final URI for calling. See `query()` method for more information.


##### Methods

There are just a few method of these kit:

```
jToxQuery.queryKit(element)
```

Returns the instance of `jToxQuery` kit, which is rooted in the closest parent of passed `element`. This is the way a widget, or main kit to find which jToxQuery it belongs to - passing it's `rootElement`, for example.

```
<jToxQuery>.widget(name)
```
Returns an instance of a widget, with given `name`

```
<jToxQuery>.addHandlers(handlers)
```
Adds the supplied set of `handlers` to the handler list recognized and used by _jToxQuery_. Without doing this referring them at certain DOM elements won't have any effect.

```
<jToxQuery>.kit()
```
Returns the main kit, that is managed by this _jToxQuery_ instance.

```
<jToxQuery>.query()
```
The most important function of the kit - the one that actually incorporates all widgets and the main kit to provide the final functionality. What it does, is to walk on all widgets and ask them to alter one and the same URI, using their `modifyUri()` method. The loop looks like this:

```
uri = widget.modifyUri(uri);
```

The initial value of `uri` is the passed `service` or empty one. After the uri is build this way, a call to main kit's `query()` is made -- et voilà!


<a name="jtoxsearch"></a> jToxSearch kit
--------------------------------------

A universal search banner kit, which integrates with [jToxQuery](#jToxQuery) to provide different ways of querying the main components, wrapped with jToxQuery. There are four search methods currently: `auto`, `similarity`, `smarts` and `url`, which are presented with different buttons.

It also provides integration with [ketcher](http://scitouch.net/opensource/ketcher) compound editor, ensuring bi-directional connection between the drawing and the search needle field.

##### Parameters

There are few things that can be setup from outside:

- **`defaultNeedle`** (attr. `data-default-needle`): Since empty searches are not allowed, this is the default search needle to be used. Default is _50-00-0_.
- **`smartsList`** (attr. `data-smarts-list`): The hierarchy for SMARTS, need to be defined outside - this is either the list object itself (when kit is manually initialized), or the name of a global variable containing the list. Default is _funcgroups_.
- **`hideOptions`** (attr. `data-hide-options`): Comma separated list of search options to be hidden - they are described above: `auto`, `similarity`, `smarts` and `url`. Default is _null_, i.e. - show everything.
- **`contextUri`** (attr. `data-context-uri`): When you need to limit the search to certain context, like - search only within a given dataset - this is the way to do it, by providing here the _URI_ which will be added as `dataset_uri` parameter on each query. Default is _null_.

##### Methods

There are just a few method of these kit:

```
<jToxQuery>.setAuto(needle)
```
Sets the search `needle`, also resetting the search method to `auto`.


```
<jToxQuery>.setMol(mol)
```
Sets the search needle to `mol`, by remembering the given data, also resetting the search method to `mol`.


```
<jToxQuery>.getNeedle()
```
Returns the current search needle - be it, as displayed in the _search box_, or as stores _mol_ compound structure definition.


```
<jToxQuery>.makeQuery(needle)
```
Initiates a query, by asking the wrapping jToxQuery kit, for the main component providing the queries. If `needle` is supplies - it makes a `setAuto()` call first, i.e. - resets the method to auto and the searching needle.

<a name="jtoxlog"></a> jToxLog kit
--------------------------------------

A network requests logger, providing feedback for success or failure on each call. Normally it should be put somewhere in the beginning of the page, so it can auto-install itself on the instance of _jToxKit_, which will make it available for all kits, during [settings inheritance mechanism](#jtox-configuration).

The notifications handled are `onConnect`, `onSuccess` and `onError` - and the requested _service_ (see `jToxKit.call()`) is used as identifier for updating status changes.

##### Parameters

There are few things that can be setup from outside:

- **`autoInstall`** (attr. `data-auto-install`): If _true_ automatically installs itself for the _jToxKit_ instance and starts to receive all network request. Default is this: _true_.
- **`resend`** (attr. `data-resend`): Whether to call old, remembered handlers for the kit, a logger is installed on. This is rarely used, because _jToxLog_ is usually installed generally on the _jToxKit_ instance and it receives all network notifications, independently of kit's handlers. This is useful if logger is installed separately on a kit to enable its handlers to still receive the notifications. Default: _true_.
- **`statusDelay`** (attr. `data-status-delay`): Number of milliseconds to keep the last success or failure status before fading it out. Default: _1500_.
- **`keepMessages`** (attr. `data-keep-messages`): How many old messages should be kept in the logger list, before starting to delete the oldest ones. Default is _50_.
- **`lineHeight`** (attr. `data-line-height`): How tall should be the (closed) request line - it can be given in normal CSS way. The opened status line (with details) has different height - enough to contain all data. Default: _20px_.
- **`rightSide`** (attr. `data-right-side`): Whether to put the status thumb on the right side of the logger. Default: _false_.
- **`hasDetails`** (attr. `data-has-details`): Whether clicking on each line's status will open a detailed info for the request (if any). Default: _true_.
- **`formatEvent`** (attr. `data-format-event`): A handler which is called to format a newly adding line (or already existing one, upon status change). The format is `function (service, state, params, jhr)` and it is called within calling kit's context (ie. _this_ parameter). The _state_ is one of `connecting`, `error` or `success`, _params_ are reflecting the `jToxKit.call()` argument, and _jhr_ is as passed on `onSuccess` or `onError`. The function should return an object with two properties: `header` and `details`, which a refilled in the logger line, respectfully. There is default implementation.
- **`onEvent`** (attr. `data-on-event`): A callback handler invoked each time an event happens. The format is `function(service, state, format)`, where _service_ is the one in operation, _state_ is the same as in `formatEvent` property and _format_ is the one returned from `formatEvent`. The invocation context is the processing it's context. Default is _null_.

##### Methods

They are pretty straightforward:

```
<jToxLog>.install(kit)
```
Installs the logger for given kit. If _kit_ is null - the (only) instance of _jToxKit_ is used, which means that all calls are passed to the logger. If `resend` setting is set to _true_ the original handlers for this kit are still called.

```
<jToxLog>.revert(kit)
```
Restores the old handlers for the kit.


How is made and how to build?
-----------------------------

The following information is not intended for end users, but it gives a detailed overview of the procedure and layout of development and building of _jToxKit_.

### General concept - js, html, css files, merging, templates, etc.

As described in the beginning, the main concept is to allow easy use of the whole toolkit - even easier than _jQuery_-based widgets and libraries. This usually contradicts with ease of development. That's why we established certain structure and rules of development process, so we can keep it easy, while providing ways for automatic production of end-user files for user-page integration.

In order to archive this, these rules are followed:

- All normal HTML, JS and CSS files that are needed, have to work as-is during the development process, so that changing anything in either of them can be immediately tested in the (development) browser.
- Development files should be separate, so each kit lives in separate (script and/or styling) files. Working on thousand-lines behemoths is not an acceptable option.
- The process of preparing and packaging of the above should be automated, i.e. - no manual procedure should be involved while just-tested in development structure needs to go to production files (in our case: one JS and one CSS file).

In order to archive these there are few things that we've established


##### File naming

Each different kit, presumably needs three files: one JS, one HTML and one CSS. They all need to have same names, built like this: `tox<kit name>.<extension>`. For example for `study` kit, the three files are:`toxstudy.html`, `toxstudy.js` and `toxstudy.css`.

There is also one, general set - for the jToxKit as a whole. It has slightly different convention: `jT.<extension>`. The key moment here is that `toxstudy.html` for example, is used during the development of jToxStudy, referring jQuery, jQueryUI, jtoxkit.js, etc. files. In the same time - it **_is_** the source for final, production `jtoxkit.js` file.

##### Script and styling files merging

During [Building  procedure](#Building procedure) all script and styling files are merged together to result in **one** javascript and **one** cascading stylesheets file. It is (optionally) minified after that.

The order of merging is not specified, except the fact that jtoxkit.js (.css) is put last.

##### HTML files processing

Here comes the most interesting part - how to have development-ready HTML file and source provider for the final, production, js files in the same time? It is achieved by adding _special_ tags:

```
	<!--[[ jT.templates['mytempname'] -->
	<div>…</div>
	<!-- ]]-->
```

Being an actual HTML comment it is well ignored during development. The special format of the comment, however, enables a script to convert this to following JavaScript code:

```
	jT.templates['mytempname'] =
	"<div>…</div>" +
	"";
```
Of course, it may have more than one lines, and also it is not _necessary_ to be jT.template[] entry. However, `jT.template` entries are automatically processed during `jT.init()`, and everything in there becomes the (HTML) content of specially added `<div class="jtox-template"></div>` element in the end of body of the target, user's page.

They also enable nesting, i.e.:

```
	<!--[[ jT.templates['outerTemp'] -->
	<div>Some initial lines here
	<!--[[ jT.templates['innerTemp'] -->
	<div>More sub-template lines</div>
	<!-- // end of inner ]]-->
	</div>
	<!-- // end of outer ]]-->
```

will result in the following JavaScript code:

```
	jT.templates['outerTemp'] =
	"<div>Some initial lines here";
	
	jT.templates['innerTemp'] =
	"<div>More sub-template lines</div>" +
	""; // end of inner
	
	jT.templates['outerTemp'] +=
	"</div>" +
	""; // end of outer
```

##### Building scripts

There are two scripts, involved in the process:

- [html2js.pl](bin/html2js.pl) - Perl script for converting html to javascript in the specified way; 
- [jsminify.pl](bin/jsminify.pl) - a Perl script for minification (Copyright (C) 2007 by Peter Michaux);
- [build.sh](bin/build.sh) - a (bash) shell script for running the above, merging necessary files and writing the final, production ones.
- [htmlextract.pl](bin/htmlextract.pl) - a Perl script which extracts referred JS or CSS files from within the input and merges them altogether in the output.


### Building procedure

It is as simple as running the `build.sh` script! It can, even be run without parameters which will result in building all kits, not minifying them:

```
$ ./build.sh 
Clearing old files...
Backing tool [ketcher]...
Processing targets [common toxcompound toxstudy jtoxkit]...
Merging JS files from [../scripts] ...
Adding html2js transformed ones from [..]...
Merging CSS files from [../styles] ...
Done.
```

However, there are few parameters that can be provided, mainly for setting new paths:

```
Usage: build.sh [options]
Options can be one or more from the following:

    [--min | -m]           : run minification of the output js, producing additional .min.js file.
		[--clean | -c]         : clean all pre-existing files in the output folder.
    [--html <html dir>]    : the directory where html files live. Default is [..].
    [--out <output dir>]   : the directory where output files should be put. Default is [../www].
    [--css <styles dir>]   : the directory where styling files live. Default is [../styles].
    [--js <js dir>]        : the directory where script files live. Default is [../scripts].
    [--target <kit list>]  : list of kits to be included. Omit jtoxkit. Default [toxstudy].
    [--lib | -l <filename>]: html file name, referring to some external library (tool).
    [--help | -h]          : this help.

Default is like: build.sh --html .. --out ../www --css ../styles --js ../script --target toxstudy
```

The result of this script can be directly used. There is a test page for proper result, which should not produce errors when opened in the browser [test.html](www/test.html).

##### A word on external tools / libraries

You can include certain libraries to be packed during building process. Like it is done with [ketcher](http://scitouch.net/opensource/ketcher). The way it is designed to happen is:

- Download all tool's files, most probably having one _html_ file including all necessary scripts and stylesheets.
- Refer this _html_ file in _build.sh_ call, like this: `build.sh ... -lib ../../ketcher/ketcher.html`.
- What will happen will be that JavaScripts referred in the html will be merged together in a single JavaScript file, named after _html_ file referred. (e.g. `ketcher.js`).
- The content of the _html_ file itself will be transformed into JS string (using `html2js.pl` tool) and added to the same JavaScript file.
- Also all stylesheet files will be merged together in a single .css file named after the referred _html_ file (e.g. `ketcher.css`). Both will be placed in the given output directory.
- The js-transformed html content will be added as `jToxKit.tool[]`, which means it can be inserted later into the page using this global method: `jT.insertTool(name, root)`

With the given example the call is:

```
jT.insertTool('ketcher', jT.$('#ketcher-test')[0]);
```

Any additional initialization that the particular tool needs, has to be called separately.
